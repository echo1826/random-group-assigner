# Random-Group-Assigner

This is a basic Group assigner that accepts an array of names and groups them by 4. It doesn't handle remainders so if the number of students is not divisible by 4 the last group will have less than 4. Future development will be done to handle that issue.

# Built Using
- JavaScript

# Future Development
1. Deal with Remainders
2. Allow variable group sizes
3. Allow I/O for user to input their own names
